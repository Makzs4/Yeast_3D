# Agent-based model for simulating 3D yeast colonies

This is the model I developed for my final thesis.

## How to use

After downloading every file in this repository, open and run 'Yeast_3D_1_0' in MATLAB.
I used R2018B during development, so I would recommend using the same version or newer for running it.
The model's initial parameters can be found in '3D_parameters.csv'.
Most of the parameters can be changed in accordance with the user's wishes, unless stated otherwise in the .csv file.
However,  I would advise against running the simulation with huge plate parameters, as it is both unnecessary and will cause the model to be very, very slow. A 100x100x20 simulation space should suffice every need.
Most functions have multiple versions, as they have been constatly upgraded or completely redone. In 'Yeast_3D_1_0' the best working versions are called.

## FAQ

* ### I just stumbled upon your repository, can I use your code?
  I'm sorry, but no. Hence why I didn't include any type of licence in the first place.
  The sole reason my work is here on GitHub is because it has to be publicly available by the rules of my university.
